# Arianna Method Os Desktop-2

Arianna Method Os Desktop-2 is an experimental desktop messaging application built with Java and JavaFX.

The project began as a reinterpretation of the open-source Telegram client, focusing on clarity, modularity, and educational value.

At its core, the application relies on a local socket-based server that orchestrates message routing between clients.

The client interface is constructed with FXML layouts and the JFoenix library, providing material design components for a modern feel.

Each screen is managed by a dedicated controller, linking user actions to the underlying view models and application logic.

User authentication is handled through a lightweight `AuthService` class that currently validates fixed username and phone combinations.

Messages are represented by `MessageViewModel` objects that capture content, timestamps, direction, and attachments for rendering in the UI.

To optimize network usage, the `MessageBatcher` groups outgoing messages before transmission to the socket server.

List views display conversations using custom cell controllers, allowing messages and images to be rendered through reusable nodes.

Graphical resources such as the home screen, login form, and settings panel are defined in separate FXML files under the `Views` directory.

The design embraces a clear separation between models, views, and controllers, making the codebase approachable for JavaFX learners.

Although the system ships with a minimal feature set, it already supports sending and receiving text as well as image-based messages.

A collection of screenshots in the repository illustrates the interface, showcasing the logo, the home view, and sample conversations.

Unit tests written with JUnit verify utility classes like the authentication service and ensure that UI controllers can reuse loaded nodes.

During the audit, tests depending on JavaFX were attempted in a headless environment, revealing limitations when no graphical pipeline is available.

The project is distributed under the permissive MIT License, encouraging experimentation and community contributions.

Developers can build the application by compiling the sources with Java 11 or later and executing the `Main` class from the `Controllers` package.

Running the program in two instances allows basic end-to-end messaging, where one instance may act as the server for the other.

Future enhancements outlined by the maintainers include replacing the local server with a scalable backend and adding account management features.

Additional goals mention persistent storage for messages and multimedia, richer messaging options, and social elements like avatars and stickers.

Contributors are welcome to fork the repository, propose improvements, and submit pull requests that align with the project's clean coding style.

This revised documentation encapsulates the current state of Arianna Method Os Desktop-2 and records the auditing updates performed in this iteration.
